# üõ†Ô∏è Technical Onboarding Troubleshooting Guide 

This document provides solutions to common issues faced by Student Ambassadors during Technical Onboarding. Authored by Darsh Manoj, Microsoft Learn Gold Student Ambassador.

## üéì Unable to Verify University ID 

When signing up for Azure for Students, you may encounter an error indicating that your university ID is not valid. 

**Solution:**
> To resolve this, first achieve Alpha status. Technical Onboarding is only required for Beta status, not Alpha. Once you attain Alpha level, you can proceed using your Student Ambassador account as usual.

## üí≥ Asked to Enter Credit Card Details 

You might be prompted to enter credit card details when attempting to sign up for the Azure trial offer.

**Solution:**
> Stop and go back. You are in the wrong place. Either sign up for [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=%3Fwt.mc_id%3Dstudentamb_260352) or get to the Alpha level and then use your Azure subscription.

## ‚úÖ Unsure if You Have Completed Technical Onboarding 

> To confirm completion of Technical Onboarding, ensure you have filled out the [Onboarding Completion Form](https://forms.office.com/r/UnJgmjap4U). If you have completed the form, your Student Ambassador Community Program Manager (CPM) will contact you regardless of the status of your technical onboarding process.

## ‚ùìOther Issues or Still Stuck
